This is an analysis of labor data to predict future labor trends. The majority of the data is from the United States Department of Labor Statistics.

Outline:

1. Retreive the labor reports
2. Combine the reports into one time series file (called a tsibble in this system)
3. Run time series models to predict future numbers
4. Run time series models to predict future changes

Part 1: Retreive the data
